**Where do we go to school and why?** White flight and educational segregation in North Island secondary schools.

This was my first major R project, in which I used publicly available data from the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/wellington/departments/publichealth/research/hirp/otago020194.html#2018), the [Ministry of Education](https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/directory-of-educational-institutions/resource/20b7c271-fd5a-4c9e-869b-481a0e2453cd) and Stats New Zealand to investigate relationships between various characteristics of schools and their neighbourhoods in the North Island.
